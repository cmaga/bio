                I'm currently completing my final year at Northeastern University. I have experience as full-stack
                developer. Due to my engineering background I am proficient in c++ and have knowledge of computer
                architecture and organization as well as circuit analysis/design. As a pc gamer I am also good
                with building computers, maintaining, and generally getting the most out of them.

            I love growing and improving my skill set.
            While building creative UI and well built front ends is intrinsically fun,
            I'm most attracted to hard engineering problems that require creative problem solving.
            I am seeking to develop skills for a career that will allow me to contribute to complex projects. I am excited
            about the future and want to play a part in the technology that is to come.

            My personality type is consistently <a href = "https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality">INTJ-T</a> summarized as "thoughtful tacticians that love perfecting the details
            of life, applying creativity and rationality to everything they do. Their inner world is often a private, complex one".
